<h1>Sending SMS using Amazon Pinpoint</h1>
<p>You can use the Amazon Pinpoint API to send SMS messages (text messages) to specific phone numbers or endpoint IDs.
This project contains complete code examples that you can use to send SMS messages through the Amazon Pinpoint API by
using an AWS SDK.</p>
<p>This example assumes that you've already installed and configured the SDK for Java.

This example also assumes that you're using a shared credentials file to specify
the Access Key and Secret Access Key for an existing IAM user.
For more information, see <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/setup.html#setup-credentials>Set default credentials and Region in the AWS SDK for Java Developer Guide.</p>
